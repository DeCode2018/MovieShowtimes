Movie Showtime is a CLI project I built as a way to showcase my understanding of databases and CRUD.


Objectives
+ Design a Command Line Interface (CLI) application
+ App should have full Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) capabilities
+ App should have 3 models: Theater, Movie and Showtime...Showtime is the join table of Movie and Theater



How to use:
Navigate into your fork of MovieShowtime
In the console, type 'ruby bin/run.rb'
Greeting and Menu you should display and speak to you.
Select from menu the action you want to run by # (i.e. '7' (without the quotes))
Follow prompts on screen.

Note: If you dare to be adventurous and select option 11. Hold down ESC + x keys then type "tetris" or "pong".
To escape, use ctrl + z.

Enjoy and thanks for stopping by!
